# Student-Request-and-Issue-Management-Automation
An end-to-end automation built with n8n to handle student requests such as complaints, leave applications, academic queries, and document requests. The system routes requests based on type, department, and priority, logs them into department-wise Google Sheets, and sends automated notifications to students and administrative staff.
